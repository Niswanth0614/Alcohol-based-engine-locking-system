# Alcohol-based-engine-locking-system



**ABSTRACT**


The project represents our final project in which we seek to address the problem of loss of life and property due to drunk driving. In our project, we used an Arduino Uno3 microcontroller connected to an alcohol sensor that detects the presence of alcohol by analyzing the breath of the person driving the vehicle. The vehicle's engine will shut off and the emergency siren will sound once alcohol is detected, minimizing the chances of any accidents that may have occurred. This will prevent loss of life and property. An alcohol sensor is installed on the steering wheel of the car, with the ultimate goal that when the alcohol level exceeds a reasonable farthest point where starting the vehicle will kill and the engine will stop. The Arduino always uses the information from the alcohol sensor to check for drunk driving and uses the screw on the vehicle's engine to stop the engine.
